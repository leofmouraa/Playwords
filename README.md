# FEUP-PROG
Programs and scripts developed during the PROG course at FEUP. 
When I made all of this I was just starting with C++ and I was just in the first year of my masters. This means there's a lot, and I mean a LOT, of spaghetti code in here. You have been warned. 

## Exercises
This are some programming exercises I solved during classes to get confortable with the language. 

## Project 1 - Playwords
This is the first project of the course, more information can be found in the ReadMe.txt file of the project.

## Project 2 - Crosswords
This is the first project of the course, more information can be found in the README.txt file of the project.


**Note** : Both projects were made with my Eduardo Ribeiro.
