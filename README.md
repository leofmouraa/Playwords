# Programming
Programs and scripts developed during the Programming course at FEUP. 
When I made all of this I was just starting with C++ and I was just in the first year of my masters. This means there's a lot, and I mean a LOT, of spaghetti code in here. You have been warned.

Both projects were made with my partner Eduardo Ribeiro.

## Exercises
This are some programming exercises I solved during classes to get comfortable with the language. 

## Project 1 - Playwords
This is the first project of the course, more information can be found in the [ReadMe.txt](https://github.com/leonardofmoura/Programming/blob/master/Project%201%20-%20Playwords/ReadMe.txt) file of the project.

## Project 2 - Crosswords
This is the second project of the course, more information can be found in the [README.txt](https://github.com/leonardofmoura/Programming/blob/master/Project%202%20-%20Crosswords/README.txt) file of the project.
